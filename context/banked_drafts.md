# Banked Drafts

## Purpose

Collection of strong draft posts set aside for future refinement and publication. These represent concepts worth developing carefully rather than rushing to publish.

-----

## PUBLISHED â€” Remove from active bank

### Asymmetric Bets - "Bet Small, Win Big"
**Status:** PUBLISHED January 31, 2026
**Note:** This was the HIGH PRIORITY draft. Now live on the blog.

## HIGH PRIORITY â€” Ready or Near-Ready

### Permission vs Permissionless - "Stop Asking"

**Date Generated:** February 1, 2026
**Style:** Provocative (Foundation)
**Why Banked:** Strong draft generated during Feb 1 rotation but "Luck Has a Surface Area" was selected. Aligns directly with sovereignty/permissionless theme â€” core to blog identity.

**Current Draft:**

Most people wait for permission. Permission to start. Permission to try. Permission to publish. Permission to ship.

The permission never comes. Or it comes too late to matter.

Permissionless systems don't wait. Bitcoin didn't ask banks for approval. Wikipedia didn't ask encyclopedias. The open internet didn't ask anyone.

They just existed. And became essential.

You don't need credentials to write. You don't need approval to build. You don't need a track record to start.

The gatekeepers used to control access. Now the gate is open. Walking through it is the only permission you need.

The world is permissionless. Most people still act like it isn't.

**Notes for Iteration:**
- Draft was ready as written during generation
- Bitcoin/Wikipedia/internet examples are original (not Taleb)
- Observation ending â€” strong, no changes needed
- RSS summary: "The world is permissionless. Most people still act like it isn't."
- Could publish as-is next week

### Red Lines - "Draw the Line"

**Date Generated:** January 23, 2026
**Style:** Provocative (Foundation)
**Why Banked:** Strong message about boundaries, didn't fit rotation but solid concept

**Current Draft:**

Most people negotiate everything. Every boundary is flexible. Every principle has exceptions. Every standard bends under pressure.

This isn't open-mindedness. It's drift.

Red lines aren't about being rigid. They're about knowing what you won't trade. What you won't compromise. What stays non-negotiable even when it costs you.

No lying, even when convenient. No compromising values for comfort. No tolerating disrespect, even from important people.

The people who seem most free often have the clearest boundaries. They know what they won't do, which makes everything else simpler.

Flexibility without boundaries isn't freedom. It's formlessness.

**Notes for Iteration:**
- Strong opening contrast and assertion ending
- "Formlessness" is a powerful concept
- Could use more concrete examples of red lines
- Consider whether examples need to be more personal
- Near-ready, might need one round of tightening

### Skin in the Game - "Whose Skin Is It?"

**Date Generated:** January 20, 2026
**Style:** Provocative (Foundation)
**Why Banked:** Strong contrarian message about trust and incentives

**Current Draft:**

Everyone has an opinion. Most people have incentives. Few people have skin in the game.

The pundit faces no consequences when their predictions fail. The consultant leaves before their recommendations backfire. The advisor risks nothing when you follow their advice.

But you live with the outcomes. Your time, your money, your relationships, your future. The consequences are yours alone.

This reveals who to listen to: People with something to lose. People who've done the thing they're talking about. People whose advice, if wrong, costs them something real.

Words are cheap. Risk is expensive. Trust the expensive signals.

**Notes for Iteration:**
- "Trust the expensive signals" is a strong closer
- WARNING: "Watch What They Buy" (Jan 29) covers expensive signals territory â€” this post needs to be differentiated clearly
- Angle here is WHO to listen to. Jan 29 was HOW to read signals. Different enough but space them out.
- Could use more concrete examples of "expensive signals"
- Assertion ending works

## NEEDS WORK â€” Requires iteration before publishing

### Emergence - "Set the Rules. Let It Build."

**Date Generated:** January 22, 2026 (title updated Feb 1)
**Style:** Observational (Foundation)
**Why Banked:** Interesting concept but needs more grounding and personal application

**Current Draft (tightened Feb 1):**

Wikipedia runs on three rules: anyone can edit, changes are visible, disputes go to discussion. No master plan. No central committee.

The result: the largest encyclopedia in history.

Bitcoin runs on a handful of rules about transactions and proof-of-work. No CEO. No headquarters.

The result: a global monetary network.

Cities work the same way. Zoning laws, property rights, roads. Simple constraints. Millions of individual decisions. Unplanned complexity.

You don't need to design the cathedral. You need to set the conditions that let it build itself.

This works for personal systems too. Define the rules. Follow them consistently. Let the outcomes emerge.

**Notes for Iteration:**
- Title improved from "Simple Rules, Complex Outcomes" to "Set the Rules. Let It Build."
- Examples (Wikipedia, Bitcoin, cities) are strong and original
- Personal application line added but could be developed further
- "You don't need to design the cathedral" is the anchor line
- Needs one more concrete personal example to land

### Antifragility - "What Doesn't Kill You"

**Date Generated:** January 24, 2026
**Style:** Observational (Foundation)
**Why Banked:** Strong concept, well-explained progression, but felt slightly academic

**Current Draft:**

Some things break under stress. A glass. A bridge designed too light. A rigid plan.

Some things stay the same under stress. They absorb the shock and return to form. Resilient, but unchanged.

Some things get stronger under stress. Muscles after lifting. Immune systems after exposure. Skills after challenge.

That's antifragility. Not just surviving stressâ€”benefiting from it. Gaining from disorder. Growing through volatility.

Most people optimize for not breaking. They build fragile systems wrapped in bubble wrap. Safe until they're not.

Better to build systems that need stress. That get weaker without it. That actually improve when shaken.

Fragile avoids. Resilient withstands. Antifragile gains.

**Notes for Iteration:**
- WARNING: Three-part progression (fragile/resilient/antifragile) is Taleb's framework and his examples (glass, muscles, immune system) echo his work closely
- Needs completely new examples to avoid Taleb echo
- Laurent's expertise could provide original examples (risk management stress testing? alpine climbing exposure?)
- Three-line closing is strong â€” keep the structure, change the examples
- Core concept is foundational to blog but execution needs rework

### Lindy Effect - (Title TBD)

**Date Generated:** January 20, 2026
**Style:** Observational (Foundation)
**Why Banked:** Strong concept from unexplored Historical Patterns territory

**Current Draft:**

Ideas have life expectancy. The longer something has survived, the longer it's likely to survive.

A book published 100 years ago that's still read today will probably be read 100 years from now. A technology that's been around for decades isn't going anywhere soon. Principles that have worked across centuries will likely work tomorrow.

This is the Lindy Effect. Time is the ultimate filter. What survives carries information about what works.

The new isn't automatically better. The old isn't automatically obsolete. But the really oldâ€”the ideas, tools, and practices that have survived wave after wave of changeâ€”those deserve your attention.

Most of what's trending today won't matter next year. What mattered to your grandparents might matter to your grandchildren.

**Notes for Iteration:**
- WARNING: Opening examples (books surviving centuries, technologies lasting decades) are classic Taleb Lindy examples. Laurent flagged this on Jan 30 â€” needs completely new examples
- Concept is solid. Execution echoes Taleb too closely
- Need original examples that feel like Laurent's voice, not Taleb's
- Ending is strong: "What mattered to your grandparents might matter to your grandchildren."
- Hold until we find the right angle

### Maintenance Debt - "What You Don't Maintain, You Lose"

**Date Generated:** January 22, 2026
**Style:** Provocative (Foundation)
**Why Banked:** Strong message, challenges build-obsessed culture

**Current Draft:**

Everyone wants to build. Nobody wants to maintain.

New projects are exciting. Maintenance is boring. Creation gets celebrated. Upkeep gets ignored.

But everything degrades. Relationships need attention. Skills need practice. Systems need updates. Health needs consistency.

The gap between what you built and what you maintain is where things fall apart. The business that stops investing in infrastructure. The friendship that stops getting nurtured. The expertise that stops being practiced.

Maintenance isn't the price of having things. It's the only reason you get to keep them.

Creation is finite. Maintenance is forever.

**Notes for Iteration:**
- WARNING: "What You Don't See" (Jan 30) covered invisible infrastructure/maintenance territory. Too close to publish soon.
- Space at least 2-3 weeks from Jan 30 before publishing
- "Creation is finite. Maintenance is forever." is a great tagline
- Similar spirit to "The Courage to Be Boring" â€” could acknowledge that connection
- Strong as-is, just needs timing separation

### Systems vs Goals - (Title TBD)

**Date Generated:** January 31, 2026
**Style:** Practical (Foundation)
**Why Banked:** Solid draft generated during Jan 31 rotation but "Bet Small, Win Big" was selected. Clean and actionable.

**Current Draft:**

Goals tell you where to go. Systems get you there.

The goal is to write a book. The system is writing 500 words every morning. The goal is to get fit. The system is going to the gym Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

Goals give you a target. Systems give you a process. The target changes or gets hit. The process keeps running.

When you hit a goal, you stop. When you have a system, you continue.

Goals are about the future. Systems are about now. You can't control whether you hit the goal. You can control whether you run the system today.

Winners and losers often have the same goals. The difference is the system.

Focus on what you do repeatedly, not what you want eventually.

**Notes for Iteration:**
- Clean and actionable, assertion ending
- "Winners and losers often have the same goals" is the strongest line
- WARNING: Scott Adams popularized "systems vs goals" â€” concept is well-known. Need to ensure framing feels original, not derivative
- Could benefit from a personal example (this daily blog practice itself?)
- Near-ready with minor adjustments

## Review Criteria

When deciding which banked draft to develop:

**Consider:**
- Does it fill a gap in recent posts?
- Does it align with current thinking/observations?
- Does it deserve more refinement or is it ready?
- Does the timing feel right for this message?
- Does it echo a specific thinker's examples? (especially Taleb)

**Refinement Checklist:**
- [ ] Apply Scott Adams principles (active voice, short sentences, prune words)
- [ ] Add concrete/personal examples if too abstract
- [ ] Test opening hook - does it grab immediately?
- [ ] Review ending - question, assertion, directive, or observation? (vary format)
- [ ] Craft RSS summary that intrigues without explaining
- [ ] Ensure it doesn't contradict blog philosophy
- [ ] Check it doesn't overlap with recent posts
- [ ] Check examples don't echo known thinkers (especially Taleb)
