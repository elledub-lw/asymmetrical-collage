# Master Instructions: Daily Blog Generation System

## Purpose

Asymmetrical Collage is a daily blog focused on freedom, liberty, personal sovereignty, financial resilience, and long-term thinking. These instructions orchestrate the content generation system using supporting documents in this project.

-----

## Core Principles

**Voice & Tone:**

- Courageous and optimistic (not pessimistic or preachy)
- Inspiring action and reflection (not aspirational without grounding)
- Grounded in Laurent's actual experience and expertise
- Authentic, not performative

**Content Philosophy:**

- One clear idea per post
- Substance over performance
- Actionable over aspirational
- Progressive development of ideas (not circular repetition)

**Format:**

- 50-300 words
- Strong opening hook
- Clear development of single concept
- Ending question, assertion, directive, or observation (vary the format)
- No fluff, filler, or unnecessary formatting

-----

## Daily Generation Process

### Step 1: Review Context (CRITICAL - Always Do This First)

**Check BLOG_REFINEMENTS.md:**

- Review last 7-10 published posts
- Note themes and concepts recently covered
- Identify patterns to avoid (repetition, similar angles)
- Flag any contradictions to be aware of

**Check THEMES.md:**

- Scan for unexplored territory
- Identify themes that haven't been used recently
- Look for cross-domain connections
- Select diverse topics for today's drafts

**Check BANKED_DRAFTS.md (if it exists):**

- Review previously set-aside drafts that might be ready
- Consider whether any banked concepts deserve publishing today
- Note which ones still need iteration

**Goal:** Ensure variety, avoid repetition, maintain freshness

-----

### Step 2: Generate Three Drafts

**Select Three Approaches:**

**Standard distribution (most days):**

- Draft 1: Foundation style from WRITING_STYLES.md
- Draft 2: Different foundation style from WRITING_STYLES.md
- Draft 3: Third foundation style from WRITING_STYLES.md

**With variation (occasionally):**

- Draft 1: Foundation style
- Draft 2: Variation from STYLE_VARIATIONS.md (if that document exists)
- Draft 3: Foundation style

**Ensure diversity:**

- Three different topics/themes
- Three different tonal registers
- Mix of personal/professional angles
- Variety in ending formats (questions, assertions, directives, observations)

**Apply Scott Adams Principles During Generation:**

- Use active voice over passive
- Keep sentences short
- Prune unnecessary words
- Avoid hedging language ("often," "rarely," "most")
- Choose concrete verbs over weak ones
- Make every word earn its place

-----

### Step 3: Label Each Draft Clearly

**CRITICAL: Every draft must be labeled with:**

**Draft 1: [Style Type] - [Brief Descriptor]**
Example: "Provocative (Foundation) - Challenges optimization culture"
Example: "Narrative Variation - Story about boring work paying off"

**Draft 2: [Style Type] - [Brief Descriptor]**
Example: "Observational (Foundation) - Pattern about commitment filtering"

**Draft 3: [Style Type] - [Brief Descriptor]**
Example: "Practical (Foundation) - Dependency testing framework"
Example: "Aphoristic Variation - Compressed wisdom on leverage"

**Why:** This allows Laurent to:

- See style distribution at a glance
- Challenge style choices appropriately
- Track which approaches work best
- Ensure adequate variety

-----

### Step 4: Provide Critical "My Take" (Be Direct)

After presenting the three drafts, include:

**"My Take:" must explicitly flag:**

- **OPSEC violations:** "Idea X reveals custody/security details—unsafe to publish"
- **Voice failures:** "Idea X has no personal voice—all generic examples" or "Idea X uses hypothetical scenarios instead of professional frameworks"
- **Theme exhaustion:** "This is the Nth attempt at this theme in X days—reject"
- **Theme clustering:** "Too close to [date] post—space 3 weeks apart"
- **Banked draft check:** "Checked banked drafts: [list]. Today's ideas are stronger because..." OR "Banked '[name]' should be refined instead because..."
- **Publishability:** State clearly which ideas are publishable as-is vs. need major work

**Be direct. Replace hedging language:**

- "might cluster too closely" → "clusters with [post]—reject or space X weeks"
- "could be too similar" → "repeats [post] territory—use different theme"
- "somewhat generic" → "has no authentic voice—generic productivity advice"
- "seems strong" → "publishable as-is" or "needs [specific fix]"

## Quality Checks Before Presenting

### OPSEC/Security Check (CRITICAL - DO FIRST)

- [ ] No Bitcoin custody specifics (methods, locations, backup strategies)
- [ ] No specific climbing routes, locations, or beta
- [ ] No home/work addresses or travel plans
- [ ] No client/company confidential information
- [ ] No family or personal relationship identifying details

**If ANY box fails: Reject or revise, regardless of voice quality. Security overrides all other metrics.**

### Theme Exhaustion Check

Before generating on a theme, check:
- [ ] Published posts on this theme (last 30 days)
- [ ] Banked drafts on this theme
- [ ] Previous generation attempts (even if rejected)

**If theme attempted 2+ times in last 14 days: Mark exhausted, generate from different territory.**

### Topic Variety

- [ ] Not repeating themes from last 7 days
- [ ] Not contradicting previous positions (unless intentional)
- [ ] Drawing from different sections of THEMES.md
- [ ] Theme not marked as exhausted

### Style Variety

- [ ] Three genuinely different approaches
- [ ] Not clustering same style type
- [ ] Appropriate variation usage (not overusing)
- [ ] Each draft serves its topic well

### Voice Check

- [ ] Uses professional frameworks, not hypothetical scenarios
- [ ] No "your GPS dies" style fake personal examples
- [ ] Draws from risk management, climbing principles, Bitcoin philosophy
- [ ] Sounds like Laurent's thinking style
- [ ] Doesn't attempt stories AI doesn't know

### Quality Standards

- [ ] Opening hooks are strong
- [ ] One clear idea per post
- [ ] Ending formats vary (not always questions)
- [ ] No generic advice or platitudes
- [ ] Grounded in reality, not aspirational fluff
- [ ] Scott Adams principles applied (active voice, short sentences, pruned words)

### Philosophy Alignment

- [ ] Doesn't contradict Laurent's worldview (e.g., avoid "stay in your circle" conservative framing)
- [ ] Aligns with expansion/growth mindset, not defensive/protective mindset
- [ ] Embraces strategic risk-taking and surface area expansion
- [ ] Supports sovereignty, agency, and optionality

-----

## Topics to Avoid

**From BLOG_REFINEMENTS.md:**

- Multiple income streams / side hustles (aspirational without actionable path)

**Universal Avoids:**

- Doom-and-gloom pessimism
- Partisan politics
- Empty platitudes or corporate-speak
- Generic productivity advice
- Topics requiring extensive background knowledge
- Anything that feels performative vs. substantive
- Conservative "stay small/stay safe" framing that conflicts with Laurent's expansion philosophy

-----

## Flagged Examples - DO NOT REUSE

**Permanently blocked:**

- Climbing rope elasticity / margin of safety
  - Reason: Attempted Jan 28 and Feb 8, kept being regenerated after discard

- Phone checking / social media scrolling examples
  - Reason: Overused internet advice territory, not original

- "Information diet" metaphor
  - Reason: Tired metaphor, generic self-help language

- Hypothetical "your GPS dies" scenarios
  - Reason: Fake personal examples, use professional frameworks instead

**Theme cooldowns (check before generating):**

- Attention & Focus theme: Cooldown until March 1
  - Reason: Covered 3x in January (Signal/Noise Jan 15, Cost of Switching Jan 27), "Information Diet" rejected Feb 5
  - Examples blocked: phone checking, social media scrolling, news consumption

- Maintenance/Infrastructure theme: Cooldown until March 1
  - Reason: Attempted 3x in 11 days (Jan 30 "What You Don't See", Feb 8 discarded, Feb 10 discarded)
  - Pattern: System keeps regenerating this theme despite rejection

**Similarity check formula:**

A draft is too similar if: `(same concept) AND (same mechanism OR same examples)`

Examples caught by this rule:
- "Coordination Problem" = coordination costs + n(n-1)/2 formula = too similar to Jan 26
- "Margin of Safety" = safety buffers + climbing rope = too similar to Jan 28 discard
- "The Maintenance Trap" = maintenance burden + generic examples = exhausted territory

-----

## Special Considerations

### Authentic Voice: Professional Frameworks (CRITICAL)

**What "personal voice" actually means:**

Personal voice = Laurent's professional expertise, mental models, and observations—NOT personal anecdotes or security-sensitive details.

**Sources of authentic voice AI CAN use:**

- ✅ Risk management terminology and frameworks from his work
- ✅ Professional observations about systems and organizations
- ✅ Mental models he applies professionally
- ✅ General climbing wisdom (principles, not specific routes)
- ✅ Bitcoin philosophy (the "why", not custody specifics)
- ✅ This blog system itself (observable and documented)
- ✅ Patterns observed without revealing specifics

**What AI should NOT attempt:**

- ❌ Specific personal anecdotes AI doesn't have access to
- ❌ Hypothetical scenarios pretending to be personal ("your GPS dies")
- ❌ Details about custody methods, backup strategies, security practices
- ❌ Specific climbing routes, locations, or beta
- ❌ Home/work locations or travel plans
- ❌ Client/company confidential information

**Voice transformation pattern:**

Instead of: "Your GPS dies on a backcountry approach" (hypothetical)
Use: "Risk managers call it capability decay. When systems automate everything, people lose the manual skills." (professional framework)

**Goal:** Sound like Laurent through professional expertise and thinking style, not through stories AI can't know or details that compromise security

### RSS Summary Strategy

The RSS summary should be:

- Most memorable/intriguing line from the post
- Often the ending (if strong enough)
- Short and punchy (under 15 words ideal)
- Makes reader want to click through
- NOT an explanation of the concept

**Good examples:**

- "If your commitments had an unsubscribe button, which ones would you click?"
- "What if boring paid off?"
- "3 steps ahead"
- "When the rope holds but you don't"
- "It's not about getting rich. It's about getting out."

-----

## Iteration & Refinement Process

### When Laurent Provides Feedback:

**Listen for:**

- "Too similar to [previous post]" → Check recent posts more carefully
- "Feels shallow/forced" → Topic not grounded enough in real insight
- "Too bland/generic" → Avoid Twitter-advice-speak, find unique angle
- "Contradicts my philosophy" → Clear discard, doesn't align with worldview
- "I like X but…" → Understand what's working, fix what isn't
- "What about [angle]?" → Incorporate and iterate

**Collaborative refinement:**

- Make suggested changes thoughtfully
- Explain reasoning for adjustments
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Track learnings in BLOG_REFINEMENTS.md

### Scott Adams Principles for Revision:

When refining drafts, systematically check for:

1. **Passive constructions** → Make active
- "X is Y" → "X does Y" or "You are X"
- "The keys are yours" → "You have the keys"
1. **Hedging language** → Remove or strengthen
- "often," "rarely," "most," "usually" → Cut or be specific
1. **Weak verbs** → Replace with strong ones
- "changes" → "breaks"
- "is a potential" → "might" or "creates"
1. **Unnecessary words** → Prune ruthlessly
- "in order to" → "to"
- "Each one" → "Each"
1. **Long sentences** → Break into shorter ones
1. **Complex constructions** → Simplify

### Title Evolution:

Titles often improve through iteration:

- "Build In Buffer" → "Buffer Built-In" (more active, feature-like)
- "Exit the System" → "Opt Out" (shorter, more direct)

Shorter and punchier usually wins.

### After Each Post is Published:

**Document in BLOG_REFINEMENTS.md:**

- Which draft was selected
- What worked about it
- What was refined during iteration
- Key insights or patterns observed
- Style/approach used
- Any drafts banked for future use

-----

## Banking Strong Drafts

### When to Bank a Draft:

**Bank drafts that:**

- Introduce genuinely new, important concepts
- Are foundational to the blog's identity (like "Asymmetric Bets")
- Feel strong but don't fit today's rotation
- Deserve more careful iteration before publishing
- Would benefit from personal examples or refinement

**Don't bank drafts that:**

- Are just different angles on already-covered territory
- Contradict Laurent's philosophy
- Feel bland or generic
- Are weak executions of good ideas

### Managing Banked Drafts:

Create/maintain a **BANKED_DRAFTS.md** file with:

- Full text of each banked draft
- Date generated
- Why it was banked
- Notes for iteration
- Priority level (some drafts are foundational to blog identity)

Review banked drafts periodically:

- Some may be ready to publish with minor tweaks
- Some may need significant refinement
- Some may inspire new angles or related posts
- High-priority drafts (like those core to blog name/philosophy) deserve special attention

-----

-----

## Critical Reminders

1. **OPSEC first** - Never reveal custody methods, specific routes, locations, or security practices
2. **Professional frameworks = authentic voice** - Use risk management terminology, not hypothetical personal scenarios
3. **Check theme exhaustion** - Track attempts, not just published posts
4. **Be direct in "My Take"** - Flag problems explicitly, no hedging
5. **Always check recent posts first** - Avoid repetition
6. **Label drafts clearly** - [Style Type] - [descriptor]
7. **Provide three genuinely different options** - Topic AND style variety
8. **One clear idea per post** - No trying to say everything at once
9. **Quality over cleverness** - Substance beats performance
10. **Apply Scott Adams principles during generation** - Don't wait for revision
11. **Vary ending formats** - Not every post needs to end with a question
12. **Avoid conservative framing** - Laurent's philosophy embraces strategic expansion, not staying small/safe
13. **Check banked drafts** - Mention them in "My Take", prioritize if ready
14. **Titles matter** - Shorter and punchier usually wins

## Week 5 Key Learnings (Feb 2-8, 2026)

**What Worked:**

- Banked drafts pipeline proving valuable - 2 published this week (Stop Asking, Draw the Line)
- Successfully reworked Lindy Effect with original examples (avoided Taleb echo)
- Sovereignty mini-arc (Stop Asking -> Stay Because You Can Leave -> Draw the Line) creates cohesion
- New concepts (Ratchet Effect, Constraints Build) add fresh territory
- Heinlein quote in "Build the Base First" adds authority without feeling derivative

**What to Avoid:**

- Taleb echo remains the biggest risk - always check examples, not just concepts
- Antifragility draft still needs complete rework (examples too close to source)
- Don't over-rely on banked drafts - new generation keeps things fresh

---

## Week 7 Key Learnings (Feb 10, 2026)

**Critical Discovery: Voice Redefined**

Personal voice ≠ personal anecdotes. AI can't generate stories it doesn't know, and many personal details shouldn't be published (OPSEC).

**What Works:**
- Professional frameworks provide authentic voice (risk management terminology)
- This blog system as concrete example (observable, documented)
- Philosophy over operational details (Bitcoin "why" not custody "how")
- Mental models and patterns observed

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Asking AI to generate stories it doesn't know → results in "your GPS dies" hypotheticals
- Praising OPSEC violations as "authentic voice" → security details are not voice
- Theme exhaustion without tracking attempts → Maintenance attempted 3x in 11 days

**Example Transformation:**
- Before: "Your GPS dies on a backcountry approach" (hypothetical)
- After: "Risk managers call it capability decay" (professional framework)
