# Editorial Review Process

## Purpose
This document captures the systematic editorial review process used to transform generic drafts into publishable posts with Laurent's distinctive voice.

## Overview: The 9-Stage Editorial Process

1. **Current State Assessment** - Document what you're working with
2. **Systematic Evaluation** - Check structure, voice, style, philosophy, themes
3. **Voice Transformation Plan** - Identify what needs to change and why
4. **Draft Revision Options** - Generate multiple revision approaches
5. **Comparative Analysis** - Evaluate options systematically
6. **Recommendation** - Make a clear case for the best option
7. **Final Polish** - Apply Scott Adams principles rigorously
8. **RSS Summary** - Craft the hook that gets clicks
9. **Final Candidate** - Present the complete, ready-to-publish version

## Stage 2: Systematic Evaluation

### 2.1 Structure Check

**Questions to ask:**
- [ ] Does it have a strong opening hook?
- [ ] Is there a clear core concept developed?
- [ ] Does the ending format work (question/assertion/directive/observation)?
- [ ] Is the post developed enough, or does it feel thin?

### 2.2 Voice Test (Most Critical)

**The fundamental question:**
> "Could this have been written by anyone, or does it sound like Laurent?"

**Check for Laurent's unique assets:**
- [ ] Alpine climbing experience (gear, routes, safety, exposure)
- [ ] Bitcoin sovereignty journey (custody, keys, node, transition)
- [ ] Professional risk management (frameworks, threat models, contingency)
- [ ] This blog's system (automation, publishing, consistency)

**Red flags that signal generic voice:**
- Examples using "the job," "the system," "the automation" (vague)
- Historical abstractions instead of personal narrative
- No technical specificity (just "backup" instead of "cold storage recovery phrase")
- Second-person "you" without concrete scenario
- Advice-speak: "You should..." instead of "Here's what I did..."

### 2.3 Scott Adams Principles Check

**Active vs. Passive Voice:**
- Look for linking verbs (is, are, was, were, been)
- Look for passive constructions ("it was done" vs. "I did it")

**Sentence Length:**
- Flag sentences over 20 words
- Look for opportunities to break long sentences

**Pruning Opportunities:**
- "just," "very," "really," "actually" - usually unnecessary
- "in order to" → "to"
- Hedging language: "often," "rarely," "most," "usually"

**Concrete vs. Abstract:**
- Are examples specific or generic?
- Are verbs strong or weak?
- Do proper nouns appear, or just categories?

### 2.4 Philosophy Alignment Check

**Does the post align with Laurent's worldview?**
- [ ] Sovereignty and self-reliance
- [ ] Expansion over contraction
- [ ] Strategic risk-taking
- [ ] Long-term thinking
- [ ] Permissionless action
- [ ] Building alternatives vs. fighting systems

### 2.5 Thematic Territory Check

**Spacing guideline:**
- Posts on same theme cluster should be 2-3 weeks apart minimum

**Example clusters to watch:**
- Exit strategies, boundaries, sovereignty
- Systems, infrastructure, foundations
- Maintenance, debt, degradation
- Simplicity, rules, emergence

## Key Learnings: Voice Transformation Pattern

### The Pattern That Emerged

**When a draft feels generic:**

1. **Identify the abstraction** - Historical examples, "they/it" language, textbook tone
2. **Ask: "When did I actually experience this?"** - Find the personal story
3. **Lead with personal narrative** - Not abstract principle
4. **Let the principle emerge from the story** - Don't state it first
5. **End with directive or assertion** - Not just observation

**Formula:** Personal story → Outcome/irony → Principle

This is the **opposite of academic writing** (principle → examples) and creates much more engaging posts.

### Before and After Comparison

**Generic opening (textbook style):**
> "Revolutions don't announce themselves. They grow quietly in the corners until one day the old system realizes it's been replaced. The printing press didn't argue with the scribes."

**Personal opening (Laurent's voice):**
> "I didn't argue with anyone about monetary policy. I allocated savings to self-custody. No debates. No permission asked."

**The difference:**
- ❌ Abstract historical examples → ✅ Your actual Bitcoin journey
- ❌ "They" and "it" → ✅ "I"
- ❌ Textbook tone → ✅ Personal stake
- ❌ Passive observation → ✅ Active narrative

## When to Use This Process

### Full 9-Stage Review (Comprehensive)

**Use when:**
- Draft feels off but you're not sure why
- Post is on important/foundational topic
- Voice seems generic despite good concept
- Significant revision needed

### Abbreviated Review (Quick)

**Use when:**
- Draft is mostly strong, needs minor polish
- Voice is already personal
- Just need Scott Adams pass

**Quick checklist:**
1. Voice test (5 min)
2. Scott Adams principles (10 min)
3. RSS summary (5 min)
