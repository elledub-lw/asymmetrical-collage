## Intellectual Giants - Watch for Echo Risk

**CRITICAL:** When using frameworks from these thinkers, do NOT reuse their signature examples. Concepts are fair game. Examples must be original.

- **Taleb** - antifragility, skin in the game, fat tails, barbell strategy, Lindy Effect
  - His examples: barbell 90/10 split, books surviving centuries, fragile/resilient/antifragile glass
  - SKIP barbell strategy entirely (too closely identified with him)
  - Lindy Effect DONE with original examples (Feb 3)
- **Munger** - mental models, inversion, circle of competence
- **Naval** - leverage, specific knowledge, long-term thinking
- **Seneca** - stoicism, time, mortality
- **Scott Adams** - systems vs goals (handle carefully)

## Potential Series / Deep Dives

Topics that could warrant multiple posts exploring different facets:

- **Antifragility Applied** - personal, professional, financial (banked draft exists, needs rework)
- **Skin in the Game** - professional, personal, political (banked draft exists)
- **Exit Strategies** - career, location, relationships, defaults (Feb 7 covered one angle)
- **Time Preference** - investing, building, relationships, health
- **Large Organization Convergence** - Laurent's original concept, long-form candidate

## Theme Selection Guidelines

**Good themes:**
- Connect to lived experience
- Offer actionable insight or reframe
- Apply across multiple domains
- Challenge conventional thinking
- Build on previous posts without repeating

**Avoid:**
- Pure theory without application
- Topics requiring extensive background
- Overly niche without broader relevance
- Aspirational advice without grounding
- Repeating same angle from recent posts
- Reusing signature examples from known thinkers (especially Taleb)
