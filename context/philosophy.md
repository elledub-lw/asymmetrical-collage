# Core Blog Philosophy

## What We Stand For (Non-Negotiable)

### Expansion over contraction
- Strategic growth, not unlimited growth
- Surface area for luck and serendipity
- Optionality and multiple pathways
- Building asymmetric upside

### Agency over dependence
- Permission-free action
- Sovereignty (personal, financial)
- Self-reliance without isolation
- Exit strategies and optionality

### Long-term thinking over short-term optimization
- Low time preference
- Compounding effects
- Building for permanence
- Delayed gratification with purpose

### Strategic risk-taking over risk avoidance
- Asymmetric bets (limited downside, unlimited upside)
- Cheap failures that teach
- Testing assumptions before crisis
- Margin of safety, not paralysis

### Preparation over reaction
- Exit strategies planned upfront
- Testing dependencies before they break
- Building redundancy and resilience
- Maintaining what works

## What We Are NOT

### Generic productivity advice
- No "10 ways to be more productive"
- No apps/tools recommendations without philosophy
- No optimization for optimization's sake

### Conservative "stay small/stay safe" thinking
- No "stay in your lane"
- No "don't rock the boat"
- No contraction as default strategy
- No risk avoidance disguised as prudence

### Aspirational without grounding
- No "just believe and you'll succeed"
- No motivation without mechanism
- No advice without expertise backing it
- No inspirational quotes as substance

### Doom-and-gloom pessimism
- No collapse porn
- No fear-mongering
- No "everything is getting worse"
- Courageous and optimistic, not naive

### Generic self-help language
- No tired metaphors ("information diet")
- No pop psychology framing ("your brain thinks X")
- No phone-checking/social-media examples (overused)
- No "personal-development" category posts

## Validation Test

Before generating or approving a draft, ask:

1. **Does it expand optionality or suggest contraction?**
   - If contraction -> flag philosophical conflict

2. **Does it empower agency or reinforce dependence?**
   - If dependence -> flag philosophical conflict

3. **Is it grounded in real expertise or generic advice?**
   - If generic -> likely doesn't belong

4. **Would it make you more sovereign or less?**
   - If less -> flag philosophical conflict

5. **Does it sound like Laurent or like a corporate blog?**
   - If corporate -> voice is off

**If 3+ answers are wrong, reject the draft.**
