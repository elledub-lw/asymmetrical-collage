# Daily Blog Workflow Critique

## Executive Summary

**The critical issue:** Ideas lack Laurent's distinctive voice. They could have been written by any productivity blogger.

**Root cause:** Generic examples replace personal expertise. Abstract observations replace lived experience.

**The fix:** Every idea must include Laurent's actual experience—climbing, Bitcoin, risk management, or this blog's system. Replace "the job," "the automation," "the system" with "cold storage recovery," "anchor weight-test," "Python scripts."

**Secondary issues:** Theme clustering, common insights passing, banked drafts underutilized, weak self-critique.

**Bottom line:** Voice is the difference between productivity advice and Laurent's blog. Fix the voice problem first.

## Core Issues Identified

### 1. Theme Clustering Not Caught
Generation produces ideas too close to recent posts (e.g., "Test the Exits" days after "Stay Because You Can Leave"). The past posts check is failing to flag thematic overlap.

### 2. Missing Unique Expertise
Ideas lack Laurent's distinctive voice:
- No alpine climbing examples
- No Bitcoin sovereignty angles
- No professional risk management frameworks
- Generic examples anyone could write

### 3. Common Insights Passing Through
Ideas like "simple is better than complex" are productivity clichés, not fresh observations. The freshness filter is too permissive.

### 4. Banked Drafts Underutilized
Strong drafts sit in the bank (Systems vs Goals, Emergence) while new ideas get generated from scratch. Priority order is backwards.

### 5. Weak Self-Critique
"My Take" sections don't flag concerns about theme clustering, generic examples, or common insights. The self-assessment is too gentle.

## Proposed Workflow Changes

### Change 1: Prioritize Banked Drafts First
**Before generating new ideas, check:**
- Are banked drafts ready or near-ready?
- Which need just one personal example?
- Could today be the day to publish one?

**New generation only when:** Banked drafts aren't ready or don't fit the moment.

### Change 2: Require Personal Voice in Every Idea
**At least one of three ideas must explicitly draw from Laurent's lived experience:**
- Alpine climbing: Specific gear, routes, safety protocols, exposure decisions you've made
- Bitcoin sovereignty: Your custody journey, key management, node operation, transition moments
- Professional risk management: Frameworks you use at work, specific threat models, actual contingency plans
- This blog's system: Your automation scripts, publishing challenges, consistency mechanisms

**But really:** All three ideas should have personal examples. Generic examples = generic voice.

**Before/After Test:**
- **Generic:** "You test the backup before you need it"
- **Personal:** "Climbers weight-test their anchor before committing. They tug the rope. They inspect the carabiners."

**Why:** This is the difference between "productivity advice" and "Laurent's blog." Voice comes from lived experience, not abstract observations.

### Change 3: Strengthen Past Posts Check
**Before generating, explicitly:**
1. List last 7 posts with core concepts
2. Identify thematic clusters (exits/sovereignty, systems/foundations, etc.)
3. Flag if new ideas fall within same cluster
4. Space clustered themes 2-3 weeks apart

**Example clusters to watch:**
- Exit strategies, boundaries, sovereignty
- Systems, infrastructure, foundations
- Maintenance, debt, degradation
- Simplicity, rules, emergence

### Change 4: Add Freshness Test to Quality Checks
**Before presenting ideas, ask:**
- Has this insight been written 1000 times?
- What makes this surprising or counterintuitive?
- Could any productivity blogger write this, or does it sound like Laurent?
- Does this challenge assumptions or reinforce common wisdom?

**If an idea fails freshness test:** Discard and generate replacement.

### Change 5: Make "My Take" More Critical
**The "My Take" section must explicitly flag:**
- Theme clustering with recent posts
- Generic vs. personal examples
- Common vs. fresh observations
- Whether banked drafts might be better
- Concerns about any idea's execution

**Current state:** Too gentle, preference-stating
**Target state:** Real critique with specific concerns raised

## Quality Checklist (Revised)

### Before Generation
- [ ] Reviewed last 7 posts with core concepts listed
- [ ] Identified thematic clusters to avoid
- [ ] Checked banked drafts for ready/near-ready candidates
- [ ] Reviewed WEEKLY_INPUTS for current observations

### During Generation
- [ ] **Each idea includes Laurent's personal examples** (climbing, Bitcoin, risk work, or blog itself)
- [ ] Generic examples replaced with specific, lived experiences
- [ ] All three ideas explore different themes/territories
- [ ] All three pass "has this been written 1000 times?" test
- [ ] Ending formats vary (not all questions)
- [ ] **Voice test passed: "Could anyone write this, or does it sound like Laurent?"**

### Before Presentation
- [ ] Freshness test passed for all three ideas
- [ ] No theme clustering with recent posts
- [ ] Examples are concrete and specific (not generic)
- [ ] "My Take" includes real critique, not just preference
- [ ] Explicit recommendation: new idea vs. banked draft

## The Voice Problem: Generic Examples vs. Personal Expertise

### What's Missing
The most consistent failure across multiple generation cycles is **voice**. Ideas are conceptually sound but could have been written by any productivity blogger. They lack Laurent's distinctive expertise and lived experience.

### Laurent's Unique Assets
- **Alpine climbing:** Rope systems, exposure management, margin of safety, anchor testing, gear maintenance
- **Bitcoin sovereignty:** Self-custody journey, key management, node operation, transition from fiat
- **Risk management:** Professional threat modeling, contingency planning, verification frameworks, stress testing
- **This blog itself:** Daily publishing system, automation challenges, consistency practices

### The Test
For each idea, ask: **"Could this have been written by anyone, or does it sound like Laurent?"**

If the answer is "anyone," the idea needs personal examples before presentation.

## Red Flags That Signal Generic Voice

- Examples that could apply to anyone ("the job," "the city," "the automation")
- No technical specificity (just "backup" instead of "cold storage recovery phrase")
- Historical abstractions (printing press, internet) instead of personal narrative
- Second-person "you" without concrete scenario
- Advice-speak: "You should test..." instead of "Here's what I do..."

## How to Transform Generic to Personal Voice

### Pattern: Replace Abstract with Concrete Experience

**Generic opening:**
> "Everyone wants to build. Nobody wants to maintain."

**With Laurent's voice:**
> "You set up cold storage to secure your Bitcoin. Now you spend time managing multiple hardware wallets, testing recovery phrases, updating firmware."

---

**Generic example:**
> "You test the backup before you need it."

**With Laurent's voice:**
> "Risk managers test disaster recovery on random Tuesdays. Climbers weight-test their anchor before committing. They tug the rope. They inspect the carabiners. They verify before they trust their life to it."

---

**Generic observation:**
> "The printing press didn't argue with the scribes."

**With Laurent's voice:**
> "I didn't argue with anyone about monetary policy. I just moved my savings to self-custody. I didn't wait for permission. I opted out. The revolution happened in my wallet first."

---

### The Formula

1. **Identify the abstract claim** ("systems need maintenance," "verify before trusting," "change happens quietly")
2. **Ask: "When did I actually experience this?"**
3. **Replace generic "you" with specific "I" or concrete scenarios from your life**
4. **Use proper nouns and technical details:** "hardware wallet," "anchor test," "Python scripts," not just "backup" or "system"
