# Writing Styles & Approaches

## Purpose
Reference guide for the three core blog post styles used in Asymmetrical Collage. Each style serves a different purpose and appeals to different aspects of reader engagement.

## The Three Styles

### Style 1: Provocative / Challenging
**Purpose:** Challenge assumptions, provoke reflection, create cognitive dissonance

**Characteristics:**
- Opens with contrarian or counterintuitive statement
- Questions what most people accept without thinking
- Often exposes gap between what people say and what they do
- Ends with question that makes reader uncomfortable (in a good way)

**Tone:** Bold but not aggressive, questioning but not judgmental

**Structure:**
- Hook: Contrarian observation or claim
- Development: Why the conventional view is limited/wrong
- Twist: Alternative perspective or hidden cost
- Close: Question that personalizes the challenge

**Examples from Week 1:**
- "The Courage to Be Boring" - challenges performative culture
- "The Optimization Trap" (discarded) - questions blind optimization

**What Works:**
- Exposing hypocrisy or blind spots
- Reframing "virtues" as potential traps
- Making the familiar strange

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Being contrarian just for shock value
- Attacking people vs. questioning ideas
- Cynicism without offering alternative perspective

---

### Style 2: Observational / Philosophical
**Purpose:** Illuminate patterns, connect ideas, offer new lens on familiar territory

**Characteristics:**
- Starts with observation about how things work
- Draws connections between domains or concepts
- Reveals underlying structure or pattern
- Ends with question that invites deeper reflection

**Tone:** Curious, insightful, "noticing what's there"

**Structure:**
- Observation: "Here's what I notice..."
- Pattern: "This happens across different contexts..."
- Insight: "The underlying principle is..."
- Close: Question that applies pattern to reader's life

**Examples from Week 1:**
- "The Illusion of Later" - time as scarce resource
- "Building in Public vs. Building in Private" - strategic modes
- "Signal vs. Noise in Your Own Life" - filtering commitments

**What Works:**
- Drawing unexpected parallels
- Naming something everyone feels but hasn't articulated
- Revealing hidden tradeoffs
- Using concrete examples to ground abstractions

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Being too abstract without grounding
- Obvious observations dressed up as insight
- Forcing connections that don't hold
- Philosophizing without actionable takeaway

---

### Style 3: Practical / Actionable
**Purpose:** Provide frameworks, tools, or concrete approaches readers can apply

**Characteristics:**
- Opens with practical problem or question
- Introduces framework, mental model, or approach
- Provides specific examples or steps
- Ends with question that prompts action

**Tone:** Direct, useful, "here's how to think about this"

**Structure:**
- Problem: "Most people struggle with X..."
- Framework: "Here's a way to approach it..."
- Application: Concrete examples or steps
- Close: Question that prompts immediate application

**Examples from Week 1:**
- "Test Your Dependencies" - vulnerability testing framework
- "The Skill Stack Audit" - compounding vs. linear skills

**What Works:**
- Frameworks that are genuinely useful
- Concrete examples that clarify the concept
- Risk management expertise applied to personal life
- Actionable without being prescriptive

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Generic productivity advice
- Frameworks without clear application
- Too many steps or complexity
- Aspirational advice without reality check

---

## Cross-Style Elements

### Universal Requirements
**Regardless of style, every post must:**
- Open with strong hook (first sentence matters)
- Develop ONE core idea clearly
- End with question that prompts reflection or action
- Stay between 50-300 words
- Avoid fluff, filler, or repetition
- Sound authentic to Laurent's voice and experience

### Tone Guidelines
**Across all styles:**
- Courageous and optimistic (not pessimistic or doom-and-gloom)
- Inspiring action and reflection (not preachy)
- Grounded in reality (not aspirational without basis)
- Respectful of reader intelligence (not condescending)

### What Never Works
**Avoid in all styles:**
- Partisan politics
- Empty platitudes
- Corporate-speak or jargon
- Excessive emojis or formatting
- Moralizing or finger-wagging
- Topics requiring extensive background knowledge

## RSS Summary Strategy

The RSS summary should be the most memorable/intriguing line from the post, typically:
- The ending question (if it's strong enough)
- A key insight that makes you want to read more
- A reframe that changes how you see the topic
- Short and punchy (under 15 words ideal)

**Good examples from Week 1:**
- "If your commitments had an unsubscribe button, which ones would you click?"
- "What if boring paid off?"
- "Compounding skills and low time preference."

**What doesn't work:**
- Explaining the concept (summary should intrigue, not explain)
- Generic statements
- Too long or trying to summarize everything

---

## Style Selection Guide

**Use Provocative when:**
- Topic involves widely accepted but questionable assumption
- There's a gap between stated values and actual behavior
- Conventional wisdom needs challenging
- Reader needs permission to think differently

**Use Observational when:**
- Pattern exists across multiple domains
- Insight comes from connecting ideas
- Topic benefits from philosophical framing
- Goal is to shift perspective more than change behavior

**Use Practical when:**
- Laurent's professional expertise applies
- Reader needs concrete framework or tool
- Risk management lens adds unique value
- Topic calls for actionable approach

---

## Variety Guidelines

**Over a week, aim for:**
- Mix of all three styles (not clustering one type)
- Range of topics (avoid repetition of themes)
- Different emotional registers (challenge, insight, utility)
- Balance of personal/professional angles

**Red flags suggesting too little variety:**
- Same style selected 3+ times in a row
- Similar themes/concepts across consecutive posts
- Repetitive question patterns at endings
- All posts in same tonal register

---

## Evolution & Refinement

**This document should evolve as:**
- New style patterns emerge
- Certain approaches prove more/less effective
- Reader feedback suggests adjustments
- Laurent's voice and themes develop

**Track in BLOG_REFINEMENTS.md:**
- Which styles resonate most with readers
- Which produce highest-quality posts
- Which feel most authentic to voice
- Whether additional styles should be added
