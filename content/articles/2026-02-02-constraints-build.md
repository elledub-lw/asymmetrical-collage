Twitter gives you 280 characters. Poetry gives you a meter. Budgets give you a number. A workday gives you hours.

Every one of these is a limitation. Every one of them produces something.

Unlimited space produces nothing. The blank page is the hardest thing in the world. Give a writer a deadline and a word count, and they write. Give them forever and infinite pages, and they stall.

Constraints aren't obstacles to creation. They're the engine of it.

This shows up everywhere. The best architects work within tight site conditions. The best engineers solve problems within brutal material limits. The best writers write within brutal word limits.

Freedom without boundaries is paralysis. Constraints are what turn possibility into output.
