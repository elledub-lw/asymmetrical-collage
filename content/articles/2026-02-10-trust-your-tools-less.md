Trust Your Tools Less

**Summary:** When the tools fail, do you still have the skills?

**Tags:** ["dependency", "skills", "self-reliance"]

**Style:** Practical (Foundation) - Risk Management angle

**Hook:** Risk managers call it capability decay. When systems automate everything, people lose the manual skills. The backup isn’t just redundant systems. It’s maintaining the capability to operate without them.

**Core Insight:** GPS fails. Password managers corrupt. Hardware wallets brick. Not often, but eventually.

The dangerous single point of failure isn’t the tool breaking. It’s discovering you can’t function without it.

**Closing:** Pick one critical tool. Practice the manual fallback. Not because failure is likely, but because knowing you could handle it changes how you move through the world.
