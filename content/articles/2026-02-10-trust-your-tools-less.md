Risk managers call it capability decay. When systems automate everything, people lose the manual skills. The backup isn’t just redundant systems. It’s maintaining the capability to operate without them.

GPS fails. Password managers corrupt. Hardware wallets brick. Not often, but eventually.

The dangerous single point of failure isn’t the tool breaking. It’s discovering you can’t function without it.

Pick one critical tool. Practice the manual fallback. Not because failure is likely, but because knowing you could handle it changes how you move through the world.
