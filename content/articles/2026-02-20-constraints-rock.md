Give someone unlimited time and they’ll waste it. Unlimited budget and they’ll overspend. Unlimited options and they’ll choose poorly. Constraints aren’t the enemy of good decisions. They’re what makes good decisions possible.
Tom Morello built his signature guitar sound by embracing limitations. As he told MusicRadar, “I found that by embracing limitations and going, ‘This is my gear, the only variable is going to be my imagination and creativity’, I was much more creative.”* Same guitar rig for over 30 years. Same amp settings since 1988. The constraint forced innovation that endless gear options never would have.
Constraints rock.
