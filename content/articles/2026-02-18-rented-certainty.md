The GPS knows the route until the signal drops. The exchange holds your Bitcoin until it gets hacked. The expert gives advice until their incentives change.
Borrowed certainty feels safe, but it creates single points of failure you don’t control. True resilience comes from capabilities you own, not services you rent.
Most people outsource the hard parts. Navigation to GPS. Custody to institutions. Judgment to authorities. It works until it doesn’t, and when it fails, you’re left holding nothing.
Risk managers call these dependencies. Every system you depend on but don’t understand is a bet that someone else’s priorities will stay aligned with yours.
Self-custody your responsibilities. The ones that matter when everything borrowed disappears.
