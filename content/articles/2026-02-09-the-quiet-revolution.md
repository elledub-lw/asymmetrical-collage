"The Quiet Revolution"

**Summary:** Don't fight the old system. Build the better one.

**Tags:** ["revolution", "systems", "bitcoin", "emergence"]

**Style:** Observational (Foundation) with personal narrative.

**Hook:** I didn't argue with anyone about monetary policy. I allocated savings to self-custody. No debates. No permission asked.

**Core Insight:** Years later, central banks hold Bitcoin reserves. Not because anyone convinced them. Because the alternative became impossible to ignore.

**Closing:** Revolution bypasses resistance by making it irrelevant. You don't fight the old system. You build the better one.
