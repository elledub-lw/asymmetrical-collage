I didn't argue with anyone about monetary policy. I allocated savings to self-custody. No debates. No permission asked.

Years later, central banks hold Bitcoin reserves. Not because anyone convinced them. Because the alternative became impossible to ignore.

Revolution bypasses resistance by making it irrelevant. You don't fight the old system. You build the better one.
