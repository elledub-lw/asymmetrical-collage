We're good at filtering information—muting notifications, curating feeds, blocking distractions. But we rarely apply the same rigor to our own choices.

Every commitment fills your headspace. Every project demands attention. Every relationship requires energy. Not all of it matters equally, but we treat it like it does.

The hard part isn't identifying noise in your information diet. It's identifying it in how you spend your days. Most people can tell you what content is worthless. Few can tell you which of their commitments are.
