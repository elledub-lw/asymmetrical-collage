Some changes are irreversible. You learn to read—you can’t unlearn it. You see how the trick works—you can’t unsee it. You understand a concept—you can’t un-know it.

These are ratchets. Progress that locks in place and raises your baseline. You can’t slide back.

Not everything works this way. Skills degrade without practice. Advantages erode with competition. Momentum fades without fuel.

But ratchets? They stay.

Learning a language. Proving you can ship. Building a skill foundation. These don’t reset to zero when you stop pushing.

The best work creates ratchets. It makes tomorrow’s starting point higher than today’s.
