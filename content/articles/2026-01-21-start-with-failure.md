summary: “Avoiding stupid is easier than achieving brilliant”

Most people ask: “How do I succeed?” Better question: “How would I fail?”

Inversion flips the problem. Don’t ask what works. Ask what fails. Then don’t do that.

Want a strong relationship? Don’t ask what makes relationships work. Ask what destroys them. Dishonesty, neglect, contempt. Avoid those, and you’re already ahead.

Want financial security? Don’t optimize for maximum returns. Identify what would bankrupt you. Excessive debt, no emergency fund, concentrated risk. Eliminate those vulnerabilities first.

Charlie Munger built a fortune with this approach: “Tell me where I’m going to die, so I never go there.”

Prevention beats optimization. Avoiding stupid is easier than achieving brilliant.
