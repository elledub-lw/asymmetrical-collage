Bitcoin doesn't care about your credentials. Your education. Your reputation. It only cares about one thing: the cost you actually paid.

Miners commit capital, energy, and computation at scale. No shortcut exists. The energy was either spent or it wasn't. That expenditure is the proof.

For individuals the currency is different. Time. Effort. Concentration. Thirty-four days of daily publishing. Ten thousand hours of practice. The work either happened or it didn't.

In permissionless domains, credentials become optional. The work speaks before you do.

Stop explaining what you can do. Do it.
Win or lose, the proof stands.
