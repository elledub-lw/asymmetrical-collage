summary: “Scale what strengthens. Tighten what weakens.”

Some networks get stronger as they grow. Each network node and miner increases Bitcoin’s security. More people speaking a language makes it more useful. The network effect compounds.

Other networks get weaker as they grow. A startup loses agility with each new hire. A decision requires more meetings with each stakeholder. The coordination cost compounds.

The difference is independence. In Bitcoin, nodes validate independently. No coordination needed. In your startup, people must align. Every connection adds communication overhead. With ten people, that’s forty-five connections to manage.

You want network effects without coordination costs. Scale the parts that strengthen with numbers. Tighten the components that weaken with complexity.

Bitcoin scales security through independence. Your team creates leverage through focus.

Where are you paying coordination costs without getting network effects?
