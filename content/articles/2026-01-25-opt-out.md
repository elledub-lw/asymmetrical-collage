Money is permission. Every transaction goes through gatekeepers. Banks. Payment processors. Governments. Each can say no.

Frozen accounts. Blocked transfers. Denied access. Your money, their rules.

Bitcoin changes this. Not because it's an investment. Because it's an exit.

No account frozen. No transfer blocked. No access denied. You have the keys. You have control. You are sovereign.

This matters when systems fail. When borders close. When accounts lock. When permission is denied.

It's not about getting rich. It's about getting out.

Self-custody isn't just technical. It's philosophical. Your wealth. Your control. Your choice.
