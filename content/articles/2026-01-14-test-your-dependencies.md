Risk professionals don't wait for disasters to find vulnerabilities. They simulate disruptions and watch what breaks.

You should do the same for your life. Pick a dependency—income source, payment method, internet access, car, phone. Now ask: how long could I function without this?

For critical systems, test shorter windows. Could you operate for 24 hours without your phone? Three days without your primary bank account? A week without your car?

Most people discover their vulnerabilities when their backs are against the wall—scrambling for passwords, untangling accounts, piecing together what wasn't documented. Testing reveals them when you still have time to build redundancy.

Contingency planning isn't just for companies. It's how you find the gaps before they find you.

What do you think you would discover if you tested your most critical dependency today?
