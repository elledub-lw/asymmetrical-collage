You have skills. Some compound. Some don't.

Compounding skills get more valuable the longer you use them—writing, systems thinking, relationship building, technical expertise. Time amplifies their value. A skill you develop today becomes more powerful every year you apply it. This is how you build leverage.

Non-compounding skills stay linear. You trade time for output with no residual benefit. The effort resets. No leverage accumulates.

The earlier you invest in compounding skills, the more time works in your favor. Good decisions made now have exponentially more impact than the same decisions made later. Einstein reportedly called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world. He wasn't just talking about money.

Do a quick audit: What skills are you developing daily? Which ones will be worth more in five years? Which ones disappear the moment you stop?

This isn't about career optimization. It's about building leverage by putting time on your side and adopting a low time preference.

What skill are you building that time will amplify?
