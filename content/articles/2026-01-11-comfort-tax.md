**The Comfort Tax**

We pay for convenience with our capacity.

Every subscription that "solves" a problem is a skill you'll never develop. Every platform that "connects" you is a community you'll never build. Every algorithm that "curates" for you is a choice you'll never make.

The trade seems obvious: time saved, friction removed, life simplified.

But capability compounds. So does dependency.

The person who can change their own oil, grow their own food, or fix their own code isn't just saving money. They're building sovereignty. They're proving to themselves that they're not fragile.

You don't have to do everything yourself. That's not the point. The point is knowing you *could* if you had to.

Because the question isn't whether these systems will always be there for you.

The question is: what kind of person will you be if they're not?
