Every yes is a thousand nos in disguise.
When you commit time to one project, you're not committing it to everything else. When you take one meeting, you're declining all other uses of that hour. When you say yes to building one skill, you're saying no to building others.
Most people evaluate commitments in isolation. Is this good? Is this worth doing? But the real question is different: Is this better than everything else I could do with this time, energy, and attention right now?
Risk managers call this opportunity cost. The hidden price of every decision isn't what you pay. It's what you don't get because you chose something else.
I could spend another hour refining this post. I'm choosing ski holidays with my family instead.
Before you say yes to anything this week, ask: What am I saying no to? The best decisions aren't about finding good options. They're about recognizing what you're sacrificing for them.
