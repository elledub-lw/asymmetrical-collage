Your brain doesn't change tasks instantly. It bleeds.

You're writing code. A Slack notification pulls you away. You respond. You return to code. But you don't pick up where you left off. You rebuild the mental model first. That rebuild costs minutes each time.

Fifteen interruptions in a day. Fifteen rebuilds. That's not fifteen small costs. That's death by a thousand context switches.

Deep work requires protected blocks. Not because you're being precious about focus. Because context switching has a tax that compounds.

The best work happens in uninterrupted stretches. The worst work happens in fragments.

How many times are you rebuilding today?
