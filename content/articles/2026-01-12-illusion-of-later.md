We treat time like it's abundant and attention like it's scarce. We should do the opposite.

You can always make more money. You can replace possessions. You can rebuild networks. But you cannot recover a single lost hour, and you cannot learn what you needed to know yesterday.

The people building resilience today aren't waiting for the perfect moment. They're recognizing that "later" is a story we tell ourselves to avoid the discomfort of "now."

Later isn't a plan. It's a placeholder that eventually runs out of space.

What are you saving for later that deserves today?
