summary: "Freedom isn't zero commitments. It's keeping your exits clear."

The best position is one you can leave.

Jobs you can walk away from. Locations you can move from. Relationships you can end. Commitments you can exit. Defaults you can change.

Not because you will leave. Because you can.

Exit options change everything. They shift power. They preserve agency. They prevent lock-in. They keep you honest about whether you're staying by choice or by trap.

Trapped people negotiate poorly. They tolerate more. They compromise more. They drift more.

Good excuses. Deep traps. The mortgage. The kids. The career trajectory. All real, all valid, all still traps.

Freedom isn't zero commitments. It's keeping your exits clear.
