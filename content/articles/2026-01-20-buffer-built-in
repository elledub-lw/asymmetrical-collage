summary: “When the rope holds but you don’t”

---

Old climbing ropes were strong enough to hold a falling climber. Technically, they worked. But the forces from a long fall—even with the rope holding—could kill you. The rope didn’t break. You did.

Modern climbing ropes have elastic material woven in. They absorb the shock. Same fall, survivable outcome. The difference isn’t strength—it’s margin.

This principle applies everywhere. Don’t optimize your budget to spend every dollar. Don’t fill your calendar to capacity. Don’t build systems that break the moment something unexpected happens.

The space between what you can handle and what you’re handling is what keeps you from breaking. Slack isn’t waste—it’s resilience. Buffer isn’t inefficiency—it’s survival.

Here’s the practice: Look at your critical systems—time, money, energy, relationships. Where are you running at capacity? Where would a 10% deviation cause a crisis?

That’s where you need margin.
