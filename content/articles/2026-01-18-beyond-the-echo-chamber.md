The easiest way to feel right is to only attend events where everyone already agrees with you.

I went to CryptoXR yesterday—something I normally avoid. My expectation was noise. What I found was a lot of Bitcoin signal in an unexpected place.

People building real things. People asking the right questions. Just in a venue I'd written off.

The market being what it is probably helped. When prices aren't pumping, you filter out the noise naturally. The people who showed up were there for the principles, not the speculation. It reminded me of what these conferences felt like years ago.

Bear markets are good for building. They're also good for finding signal in places you'd stopped looking.

Your principles don't weaken when you test them outside your usual circles. They either hold up or they reveal their gaps. Either way, you learn something.
