Luck isn’t random. It has patterns.

People who “get lucky” aren’t just waiting. They’re creating surface area. More conversations. More projects. More experiments. More things moving.

Each one might connect. Each one could break through.

You can’t predict which conversation leads to the opportunity. Which project sparks the insight. Which experiment works. Take more shots.

Luck favors the active. Not because they’re special, but because they’re exposed. More surface area means fortune finds you more often.

Sitting still minimizes luck. Movement multiplies it.
