Bitcoin made it obvious. When you hold your own keys, you understand what ownership actually means. When you don’t, you’re just renting.

The same pattern runs everywhere. Your social media following lives on their servers. Your email list belongs to their platform. Your savings sit in their bank.

Any of them can pull the rug from under you.

Third parties aren’t always the wrong choice. But they should be a conscious one. Knowing what you’re trading and why, changes everything.

Start with one layer. Own it completely. It will change how you see everything you rent.
