summary: “The invisible work is the work that matters.”

You notice the website when it’s down. You notice the power when it goes out. You notice the road when it has potholes.

Infrastructure is invisible when it works.

The best systems disappear. They run so smoothly you forget they exist. Until they break. Then you realize how much depended on them.

Your health works this way. Your relationships work this way. Your routines work this way.

You don’t think about your knees until they hurt. You don’t think about friendships until they fade. You don’t think about morning habits until they collapse.

The invisible work is the work that matters. Maintenance. Consistency. Showing up when nothing breaks.

Step back occasionally. Assess what works that you might take for granted. Tend to it before it forces your attention.
