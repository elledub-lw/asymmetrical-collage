Luck isn't random. It's predictable in one way: the more you expose yourself, the more it finds you.

The person who reads widely stumbles into the idea that changes everything. The person who talks to strangers meets the one who opens a door. The person who ships regularly hits the post that goes viral.

None of them planned it. All of them created the conditions.

Luck doesn't reward the talented. It rewards the exposed. Talent without surface area stays invisible. Surface area without talent still gets lucky sometimes.

Increase your surface area. Ship more. Talk to more people. Say yes to things that don't fit the plan.

Luck is not a gift. It's a math problem.
