Climbers weight-test their anchor before they trust it. Tug the rope. Weight the anchor. Apply pressure gradually, then commit full body weight.
Only after the system holds do they climb.
Verification before trust isn’t paranoia. It’s practice. You’re not questioning the gear. You’re confirming what you need to know.
Run the backup restore before you need it. Test the disaster recovery on a quiet Tuesday. Validate the transaction yourself instead of trusting what someone tells you.
