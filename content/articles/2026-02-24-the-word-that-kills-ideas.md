Most ideas don’t die in execution. They die in the room where they’re first spoken.

Not because the idea is bad. Because the framing signals low conviction before the idea has a chance.

“We should probably maybe look at…” is a different sentence than “Here’s what I think we should do.” Same idea. Different odds.

Before anyone else evaluates the idea, your word choice signals whether you believe it. Qualifiers aren’t humility. They’re friction. They ask the listener to do extra work, to discount the hedge, find the signal, evaluate the idea underneath.

Precision doesn’t mean certainty. It means saying exactly what you know and exactly what you don’t. “I’m confident in X. I’m less certain about Y.” That’s honest. “I sort of think X might be worth considering” is just noise with a disclaimer attached.

The clearest thinkers speak the most directly.
