You can't control whether you hit the goal. You control whether you run the system.

This blog has published every day for 36 days. Not because the goal is clear. Because the system makes publishing easier than not publishing.

Winners and losers often have the same goals. The difference is the system.

Focus on repetitions, not what you want eventually.
