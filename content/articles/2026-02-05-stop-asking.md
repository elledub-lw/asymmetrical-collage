Most people wait for permission. Permission to start. Permission to try. Permission to publish. Permission to ship.

The permission never comes. Or it comes too late to matter.

Permissionless systems don’t wait. Bitcoin didn’t ask banks for approval. Wikipedia didn’t ask encyclopedias. The open internet didn’t ask anyone.

They just existed. And became essential.

You don’t need credentials to write. You don’t need approval to build. You don’t need a track record to start.

The gatekeepers used to control access. Now the gate is open. Walking through it is the only permission you need.

The world is permissionless. Most people still act like it isn’t.
