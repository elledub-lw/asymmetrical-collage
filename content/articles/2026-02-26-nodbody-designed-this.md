Nobody designed the English language. No committee approved its grammar. No authority decided which words survived and which didn't.

It emerged. Millions of individual decisions, what to say, how to say it, what got understood, accumulated into something more coherent than any planned system could have produced.

This happens constantly. Markets price information no single analyst holds. Cities develop character no urban planner intended. Ecosystems regulate themselves with no regulator.

Most people assume good outcomes require someone in charge, a plan, a committee, oversight. But the most durable systems have none of that. They have rules and participants who follow them. Simple rules, consistently applied, over time. Complexity follows without anyone designing it.

Bitcoin works this way. No CEO decides the monetary policy. The rules run. The network follows. The result is harder money than any central bank has produced.

It was never about who's in charge. It's whether the rules are right.
