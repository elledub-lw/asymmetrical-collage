summary: "What if boring paid off?"

Everyone wants to be interesting. Few people want to do interesting things.

Interesting things require long stretches of boring work—research, practice, iteration, patience. Most people would rather appear interesting by consuming and commenting than become interesting by creating and building.

Social media rewards the performance of curiosity more than actual exploration. It's easier to share hot takes than to develop expertise. Easier to signal taste than to develop judgment.

But boring pays off. The most interesting people you know probably spent years being boring. They were in the lab, the garage, the library, the practice room. Alone. Working.

What boring work are you avoiding because you'd rather seem interesting?
