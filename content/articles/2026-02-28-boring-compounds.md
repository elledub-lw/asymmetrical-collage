My Python scripts that automate this blog aren't glamorous. No one asks about them. They just run every day, handling everything that doesn't require an editorial decision. Six months of small improvements compound into infrastructure that removes friction without removing judgment.

This happens everywhere. The daily habit no one sees. The automated backup that never fails. The filing system that makes everything findable. None of it is exciting. All of it compounds.

The visible work gets the attention. The invisible work gets the results.
