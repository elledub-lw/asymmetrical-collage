Perfection is a trap. Not because perfect isn’t good—it is. But because perfect never ships.

You can spend months polishing a project that needed weeks. Refining details nobody will notice. Solving problems that don’t exist yet. Waiting for conditions that won’t come.

Meanwhile, done teaches you what perfect never could. Real feedback. Actual use. What works, what doesn’t, what matters.

The work improves through iteration, not meditation. Version 1.0 shipped beats Version 3.0 imagined.

Here’s the test: If you’re not a little embarrassed by your first version, you waited too long.

Perfect is the enemy. Done is the teacher.
