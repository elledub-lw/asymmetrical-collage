The best bets have limited downside and unlimited upside.

Start a blog. Costs time. Might open doors you can't see yet. Meet someone interesting. Costs energy. Could change your trajectory. Learn a new skill. Costs effort. Compounds for decades.

Asymmetric.

Most people avoid these bets. They see the cost clearly and the upside vaguely. They protect what they have instead of reaching for what's possible.

But you can afford to lose small ten times if winning once pays for everything.

That's not gambling. That's engineering favorable odds.

Risk little. Stand to gain much. Repeat.
