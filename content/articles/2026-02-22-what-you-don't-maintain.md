Everyone wants to build. Nobody wants to maintain.

New projects are exciting. Maintenance is boring. Creation gets celebrated. Upkeep gets ignored.

But everything degrades. Relationships need attention. Skills need practice. Systems need updates. Health needs consistency.

The gap between what you built and what you maintain is where things fall apart. The business that stops investing in infrastructure. The friendship that stops getting nurtured. The expertise that stops being practiced.

Maintenance isn't the price of having things. It's the only reason you get to keep them.

Creation is finite. Maintenance is forever.
